# OpenXRHand Test Suite

This project is a test suite for the OpenXRHand changes in https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/86906

The following main scenes demonstrate different capabilities:

- humanoid_avatar.tscn
- humanoid_hands.tscn
- humanoid_hands_follow.tscn
- openxr_avatar.tscn
- openxr_hands_follow.tscn
- openxr_hands_full.tscn
- openxr_hands_no_palm.tscn

Note: Where models had to be modified to have the correct OpenXR/Humanoid bones; the meshes do not look very good at the joints as little effort was put into correctly weight-painting the bones.
